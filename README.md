Fast, Precise Myelin Water Quantification using DESS MRI and Kernel Learning  
[http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08908]

## Getting Started

1. Install the Michigan Image Reconstruction Toolbox, available for free download [here](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/code/).

2. Replicate the paper's results by following directions within subdirectories of `./exp`.

3. For implementations of PERK and other tested estimators, go to `./map`.

4. For implementations related to Bayesian acquisition design, go to `./opt-scan`.
