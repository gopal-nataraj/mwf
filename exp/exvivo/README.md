# Getting Started

1. Modify the first few lines of `main.m` to point to your local copy of MIRT.

2. Run `main.m`, which should execute within a couple minutes on a typical desktop. Myelin water image results should be the same as in the paper. Additional results include PERK estimates of nuisance parameters (e.g., T2f, T2s) and MESE T2 spectrum estimates; these were omitted from the paper for brevity and clarity in presentation.
