## Getting Started 

1. For implementations of the estimators used for myelin water imaging from DESS and/or SPGR pulse sequences, go to `./dess-spgr/` and check out `mri_multicomp_map.m` first.

2. For implementations of the conventional estimators used for myelin water imaging from MESE pulse sequences, go to `./mese/` and check out `mri_mese_mwf.m` first.
