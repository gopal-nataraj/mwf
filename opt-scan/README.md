# Getting Started 

1. Modify the first few lines of `dess_spgr_2comp_Popt_test.m` to point to your local copy of MIRT.

2. Run `dess_spgr_2comp_Popt_test.m` to optimize the acquisition.

3. Feel free to modify and play around with initialization (`P0`), time constraints (`lincon.tr`), optimization options (`fminconOpt`), etc.
